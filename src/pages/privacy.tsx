            </ul>
          </div>
          <h3>Analytics Cookie Types</h3>
          <p>- \_\_utma</p>
          <p>
            🤚 This cookie is used to determine new and returning visitors. It has an expiration time of 2 years. If the
            ga.js library is executed and no \_\_utma cookie exists, this will be recorded as the users’ first visit and
            a \_\_utma cookie will be set. If a \_\_utma cookie is already in place, the expiration time is reset and
            the user is recorded as a return visitor.
          </p>
          <p>- \_\_utmb</p>
          <p>
            🤚 This cookie is used to determine a new session. The cookie is set when the ga.js library executes and
            there is no \_\_utmb cookie in place. It has an expiration time of 30 minutes, therefore if a user is
            inactive for a period longer than this, a new cookie will be set when the library executes and the
            interaction will be recorded as a new session.
          </p>
          <p>- \_\_utmz</p>
          <p>
            🤚 This cookie is used to determine the traffic source, medium, campaign name and campaign term which
            delivered the user to your website. It is created when the javaScript library executes and expires after 6
            months. This helps Google collect the data which can then help them to determine which traffic sources
            assist conversions within the multi-channel section of Analytics.
          </p>
          <p>- \_\_utmc</p>
          <p>
            🤚 This Cookie waits 30 minutes, and then it expires. You see, \_\_utmc has no way of knowing when a user
            closes their browser or leaves a website, so it waits 30 minutes for another pageview to happen, and if it
            doesn’t, it expires. And is used to store information, such as what time your current visit occurred,
            whether you have been to the site before, and what site referred you to the web page.

          </p>
          <p>- \_\_utmv</p>
          <p>
            🤚 This cookie is used for storing visitor-level custom variable data. It is created when the
            \_\_setCustomVar method is used with a visitor level custom variable. Like the \_\_utma cookie, this cookie
            expires after 2 years and is reset each time the user visits your site before the expiration of the cookie.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although each of these cookies has a set expiration time, each time the ga.js library is executed and the
            expiration time has not been met the cookie is updated, resetting the expiration date to its original value.

            😜 In order to provide website visitors with more choice on how data is collected by Google Analytics,
            Google has developed the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. The add-on communicates with the Google

            Browser Add-on does not affect usage of the website in any other way. A link to further information on the
