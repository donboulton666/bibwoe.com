## The Soul

<p>The term "Jud√¶o Christian" first appears in a letter by <a href="/wiki/Alexander_McCaul" title="Alexander McCaul">Alexander McCaul</a> which is dated October 17, 1821.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>a<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> The term in this case referred to <a href="/wiki/Apostasy_in_Judaism" title="Apostasy in Judaism">Jewish converts to Christianity</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>3<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> The term was similarly used by <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Wolff" title="Joseph Wolff">Joseph Wolff</a> in 1829, in reference to a type of church that would observe some Jewish traditions in order to convert Jews.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>4<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> Mark Silk states in the early 19th century the term was "most widely used (in French as well as English) to refer to the early followers of Jesus who opposed" the wishes of <a href="/wiki/Paul_the_Apostle" title="Paul the Apostle">Paul the Apostle</a> and wanted "to restrict the message of Jesus to Jews and who insisted on maintaining Jewish law and ritual".<sup id="cite_ref-Silk-NCR-2019_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Silk-NCR-2019-6"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>5<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>
</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche" title="Friedrich Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a> used the German term <span title="German-language text"><i lang="de">"Judenchristlich"</i></span> ("Jewish-Christian") to describe and emphasize what he believed were neglected aspects of the continuity which exists between the Jewish and Christian worldviews. The expression appears in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Antichrist_(book)" title="The Antichrist (book)">The Antichrist</a></i>, published in 1895 but written several years earlier; a fuller development of Nietzsche's argument can be found in the prior work, <i><a href="/wiki/On_the_Genealogy_of_Morality" title="On the Genealogy of Morality">On the Genealogy of Morality</a></i>.
