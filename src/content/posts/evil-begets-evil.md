Break into our country violating the Eight Commandment, getting on welfare and new cars through our NGO's and non-profits with section 8 vouchers for free housing., walmart cards, cash vouchers. With money for homes in California.

Then they take our jobs,"by force and fear", making us homeless.

Drugging and killing us in violation of the 6th Commandment.

Most all the homeless in Los Angeles / Santa Monica, Venice Beach, Victorville, Hesperia, and all over California and our nation did not drop out of the sky. 99 percent are Black or White.

They had homes, dogs, cars, friends and a life. The human trash made there way into there place of work got position over them cut there hours or just belittled them to the point where they quit or could not afford to have a life anymore. 

Soon thereafter it was all hispanic or Indian / Pakistani Chinese or whomever. No more white or black people working there. The white and black's are now on the streets and wondering why you and our Government through common sense and our Employment laws don't protected them. 

> We have to hire them but they don't have to hire us??????

How many fast food places or construction companies, gas stations ... on and on are all hispanic. No white or black workers from the USA, and no one say's anything.

When you become homeless they belittle you, terrorize you, make it so there is no bathroom you can use or place to plug in your cell phone. No safe place to sleep and NO COMFORT OR LOVE OR COMPANIONSHIP! Loneliness is all you have and heartbreak. Your own people have deserted you and our once great nation.

> F*ck off America your stupid and traitors, giving away our country to evil unhuman trash.

In the news when a city like LA or NY or Chicago are going to shit what do they show you. Homeless camps. Not that all the businesses are staffed by only immigrants and not even our veterans have a place to stay or the ability to have jobs.

In Santa Monica and Venice Beach I got to know lots of the homeless people and even though they did not do drugs, drink, or even smoke they would be found dead from fentanyl overdose. Died in the middle of the night. Snuck up on while sleeping and Injected by hispanic gangs to eliminate the competition for resources, jobs and housing vouchers. 

There are tens of thousands of elderly living in there cars as the immigrant trash have there homes now. Killing the old people, Covid again, good idea if your in the Government, then they don't need there Social Security or healthcare. "THAT THEY PAID FOR". Just kill them is the best course, F*ck off USA GOV, you to Donald Trump and Tom Homan you are just talking shit. Show me idiots, "show me"!

I'll be satisfied with 50 to 70 million evictions, no less! Cut them of financially like our law's say and they will leave on there own!

No work visa's, no warfare, no HUD vouchers, no healthcare. That's our laws, "enforce them". All these immigrants have failed the test of becoming USA citizens = deport them or just cut them off!

Or prosecute them put them and there family's put them in internment camps and make them work off what they have in violation of federal law taken from us. Could take a dozen generations. Whity, Black people and American Indians would have a new slave class!!!

What is this crap.

## Donald and Tom

YOU MAY HAVE MOST OF THE USA FOOLED. As they didn't pay attention to your lack of truth and work's in the past. Both of you I could convict of Racketeering, collusion of malice intent of and by disregarding our laws. Our immigration laws are clear, an immigrant cannot be a burden on the American People or sneak into our country through our universities.

That means vetting years before entry, no welfare, no free housing, no NGO supplied cars and amenities. No food lines or food banks as they are for the citizens of the USA.

If you are white or black forget getting on your feet, you have nothing coming as HUD and the Welfare office are all Mexicans, along with the city GOV and officials. All came here illegally and now rule US.

I am so pissed, I marked your planet for deletion! Repent now; 'or "NOT"!

> I think you can see how pissed the trinity is at all of you. Massive floods all over the world,war and strange events occurring everywhere.
>
> > It's just beginning. Read revelations and get your shit together or else. There is still time to open your eyes and hearts, quit playing around and running your mouths and stand up and do something about it.
